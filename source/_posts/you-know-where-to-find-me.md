I've been thinking for a while about sharing my life schedule. I finally realized it. You can now read my schedule on this page [http://schedule.zealoft.com/](http://schedule.zealoft.com/).

I share my schedule so that you can always know know where I am, what I am doing and what I am going to do. Whenever you want to join my life, you always know when and where to. Want to watch a movie with me? Sure, check my schedule: If I'm free, I'm free. See I'm running and want to join? Great, I would love to have someone run with me. Or, for no particular reasons... Isn't that fun?

It also helps me to keep up with my schedule. Many planned events are not accomplished just because I feel lazy. However, I need to keep my words to make this page credible. I promise that you will find me as this page indicates.

I wish to receive your *pull requests* soon.


Sincerely,

Jim
