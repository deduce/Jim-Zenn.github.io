In its most general form, the problem is as follows:

The instance has a number of *agents* and a number of *tasks*. Every agent can only be assigned to perform some specific tasks. Each task has a worth. Every agent *will only and have to* work for a certain worth of tasks. It is required to perform all tasks by assigning the tasks to the agents, and the sum of worth of all the tasks is right enough for all the agents.
